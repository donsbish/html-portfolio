<h3>The Hunger Games Movies</h3>
    <p>
        I really love the genre of the film. The context and the plot twist in the end.

<h3>The Old Guard</h3>
    <p>
        The film is very cool. I love how the main characters (the protagonists) swing their weapons and eliminate their enemies.

<h3>Avatar Movies (by: James Cameron)</h3>
    <p>
        How the director created the CGI of the film is what I like and also the theme of it.
